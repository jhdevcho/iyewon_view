                                History can be seen through the biographies, one can know of God by the Bible. (Genesis 1:1, John 1:1).<br> 
                                God's providence can be found in everything, such as the earth turning (revolving, rotation), turning 23 degrees during the winter, and having four seasons, and the movements of the galaxy not colliding. <br>
                                This is evidence that there must be someone who has made it, so there are blessings for those who believe without seeing.

                                There is an English proverb that says, “One can buy many things with money, but not happiness. Money can buy all tickets, but the ticket to heaven. It can block all paths, but cannot block the path to death.”<br> 
                                Only Jesus is the way to salvation (John 14:6, Acts 4:12).<br>
                                Jesus is not just responsible for what we eat, but even our afterlife (John 3:16).<br>
                                There are people who say, “I will first earn a lot of money, then believe in Jesus.” However, even if you want to earn a lot of money, it will not go as you plan. A fish out of water cannot be happy. Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, as it goes well with your soul.

                                Confucius, who created Confucianism, is considered a superior religion because he was born about 500 years before Jesus was born, and Buddha was born about 1,000 years before Jesus. However, the birth of Jesus should not be viewed as the starting point for Christianity. <br>
                                There are two times in the Bible where it says 'in the beginning.' (Genesis 1:1, John 1:1) <br>
                                God existed from the beginning by His Word. It is said that all things were built by Jesus and has been preserved (Hebrews 1:2-3). <br>
                                Like so, it is Jesus Christ came in human form to take charge of man’s sins according to the Word. <br>
                                Therefore, believing in Jesus is not believing in a person who is called to be a saint who was born 2,000 years ago in history. It is believing in the entire schedule of God's salvation before the creation of heaven and the earth. <br>
                                Jesus is a true man and the true God. It is believing that He is the Alpha and the Omega, who has both divinity and character, the first and the later, the beginning and the end (Revelations 22:13).

                                Just because there are many denominations, it does not mean that they have different faiths. <br>
                                The foundation that is shared among the denominations within Christianity is the same. <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;First, man cannot receive salvation by their efforts and can receive salvation only by faith. <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;Second, salvation is given by the grace of God. <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the only object for salvation is Jesus. <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the Bible has the greatest authority, as it is the Word of God. <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, we must only give glory to God. <br>
                                There are different denominations, but it is that they have different detailed options within faith. It is as if siblings have different characters, even if they are born from the same parents. <br>
                                In Christianity, it is that by one’s own free will, man is to have the confession of faith to receive salvation. It cannot be forced. By the standard of the Bible, one can freely express their faith. Thus, Christianity having different denominations is not having splits, but having varieties.

                                As an example, there was a widow who visited Buddha one day and begged him to save her one and only son who had died. So Buddha replied, "Walk around and find seven houses where no one has died and get a handful of rice, I will save you." The widow wandered around all day, but there was no such house. Buddha said to the widow who returned, "Everyone must die once." Buddha was a wise man, but he didn’t have the ability to solve the problem of death. <br>
                                That's the end of the solution of death that Buddhism deals with.<br>
                                It's "religion" that man has to do something on their own. <br>
                                But Christianity says that Jesus had come as the Christ and had accomplished everything by being crucified on the cross for my sins, shedding His blood, and resurrecting (John 19:30). <br>
                                Only Jesus is the master of our lives and can save the dead. The religion of the world has limitations in trying to find true happiness through the efforts of man. However, Christian faith is not by man’s acts or efforts, but by a new life given by the living God. <br>
                                God is the only object of our faith because He is the eternal truth and life.

                                The question itself is right. But the Bible is not a man-made book. It was recorded through approximately 40 people who were inspired by the Holy Spirit. <br>
                                The reason that we believe in the Bible is because it is the Word of God. The Old Testament alone has 2,000 prophecies that have  been fulfilled. <br>
                                On the other hand, there are no specific prophecies that have  been fulfilled in the other religions. It is vague and general. However, the prophecies of the Bible are very specific and detailed. What is surprising is that we can confirm the accuracy of the prophecies through historical data. <br>
                                A prophecy is a promise. What is God's greatest promise? It's Jesus Christ. Those who believe in Jesus will have eternal life, and those who do not believe must believe, as if not, they will have the eternal wrath of God.

                                There are two kinds of sins: 'original sin' and ‘committed sin’. The sin committed by the first human being by eating from the fruit of the knowledge of  good and evil fruit, committed the original sin, the sin of leaving God. Original sin is the the sin of leaving God and the sin of committed sin are ethics, morals, mind, thoughts, and actions. The Bible says, " Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned." (Rome 5:12).<br>
                                All people are born with the grit of sin because of the original sin. Therefore, the only way of salvation to solve the original sin problem is the only way of 'Jesus Christ'.

                                The reason why people don't believe in Jesus' birth by a virgin is because they reject supernatural miracles. But is it impossible for the God who created the universe, the God who created all the tens and billions of plants and animals on Earth, to put the "Y" chromosome into a woman's womb and give birth to life? <br>
                                It's also because it is believed that the story of the birth of a virgin is seen to be a myth of the heathen. It is true that the myths of heathen predate the Gospel in which the birth of the virgin was recorded. However, the birth of Jesus by the virgin was foretold by theprophet Isaiah 700 years before the birth of Jesus, so it predates the myth of the Gentile religion. <br>
                                Because it is God's ability to transcend science, the Word should not be judged by the standards and reasoning of science. <br>
                                The question that we should abe asking is, "Why did Jesus have to come through the birth of the virgin?" He was conceived as the Holy Spirit to solve our sin problems and came in the form of an innocent human being, solving all our sins and curses through His crucifixion.

                                It's like the principle that grains and weeds are together at harvest. Look at Judah who sold Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. He was among the twelve disciples, but there was a mixture of the real and fake. <br>
                                People who are sick should seek for a doctor for treatment. If there is a doctor who can heal me, I must go to him. I must not say that I will not go because I don’t like the facility of the hospital. Like so, if you are willing to cure your disease, you must see the doctor. <br>
                                Likewise, rather than seeing and believing in church believers, please look at and believe in God. All believers who attend church are subjects of healing and need the grace of God.

                                Offering is not done by force but is voluntary, where you can give according to your faith. It is a natural blessing to give to God as people of God's kingdom, just as you live in your country and pay resident tax. <br>
                                Most importantly, God is the master of all matters. Offering is recognizing God's ownership, control, and supply. It is not just a measure of giving our material wealth, but the act of faith that returns what belongs to God to God. When you have the correct standards for offering, material wealth, and economy God will take responsibility as the host for all of your food, clothing, and shelter and fill it with abundance.

                                Do you know the story of the goat in the sheep’s cage? Let’s say you put a goat in a cage for sheep and it does not exercise or move at all. Then the sheep will move around to avoid being stabbed by the goat's horns. Without goats, they will not move, their health will deteriorate, and they will get tangled up and die. <br>
                                Likewise, God sometimes uses satan as a villain for His children. However, at the end, satan will fall into hell and be cursed with eternal judgment. God only allows satan's activities for the faith and spiritual maturity of God's children, but God is not the creator of sin. <br>
                                Like the goat in the sheep's cage, God's children should always actively pray. God seeks those who keep faith until the end to give them the reward. Above all, remember that the children of God has the power to call on the name of Jesus and bind the works of satan.

                                There are two types of prayer: the 'religious prayer' and the 'gospelized prayer'. First, 'religious prayer' is praying for my goals, greed, and profit by me  being the master of myself. It's to gain something. <br>
                                However, we must stop misunderstanding prayer and hold onto the correct meaning of prayer. <br>
                                Praying is a time to hold onto God's wish as my wish. Because God came to me and poured God's wishes on me. It's the time to give myself to fulfill God's wish. <br>
                                Hearing God's voice is a very dangerous form of mysticism. "The Word itself is the voice of God”. When you receive the Word of the pulpit, ask for faith and desperately seek the help of the Holy Spirit. This is because He has already told us of the will of God through the words of the 66 books of the Bible. <br>
                                As the champions of faith who have experienced miracles in the Bible, the miracle of response will coherently happen to us when we have faith and let our thoughts down, and believe in the Word.

                                It is because we have the ‘nature’ that we must change and the ‘mission’ that we must accomplish. We have received salvation, but there are many times that we live the life with the nature as nonbelievers. If the Word of God does not overpower you, from time to time, you may be deceived by the environment that you see and receive scars from people, and have unending conflict and disbelief. This is because our spirit has received salvation, but our physical bodies did not yet receive salvation. <br>
                                Faith grows from listening to the Word of Christ (Romans 10:17). In order to be over powered by the Holy Spirit, we must unendingly reform our natures of Genesis 3. It is not just remembering the Word with your head, but what is important is to apply it in your lives. By the 3 onlys (today’s Word, today’s prayer and today’s evangelism), we must daily come out from the spiritual old frames and be imprinted, rooted, and natured in the Gospel. <br>
                                It is also because evangelization is the command of the Lord (Matthew 28:16-20). This is the reason that the Lord has come to this land. An evangelist is like a 911 safety squad. What is most urgent is to guide the souls that are dying to the Lord. It is because God wants to save by the work of evangelization (1 Corinthians 1:21).

                                First, what is your standard of happiness? What looked good to you? You must be able to examine this and change your standard. It may seem as if nonbelievers succeed in the world and enjoy their Sundays. It is because the standard of happiness in the world is possession. <br>
                                However, people who do not know where life came from and where to go cannot be happy. If you give water and sunlight to a tree that has been uprooted, it will just help to rot. As man are spiritual beings, the body that has left God may seek for enjoyment and materialistic things, living in thirst, but it will not be the way to true peace. <br>
                                The hardships and difficulties that the children of God are facing is a time for training and reformation. It is a time for the test of faith. Do not be envious of the nonbelievers goodness, but make the hardships and problems to be the pedestal by God and believe that He will make everything for the good.

                                There are times when even amongst Christians, people ask where in the Bible it says not to drink or smoke. Do not misunderstand that you cannot come to church if you do not quit drinking or smoking. However, it is that the Bible says that our body is a holy body that the Holy Spirit dwells upon (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). It is that man has been created to give glory to God, but drinking alcohol is not good for the liver and smoking will fill your lungs with smoke—harming your bodies. <br>
                                In history, missionaries came to Korea and told of 6 things that we should ban. It is drinking, smoking, hierarchy, gambling, concubines and laziness.  Due to the teachings of the missionaries, the lives of the early Korean churches have been placed in order. Even today, this is influenced and believers who believe in Jesus differentiate themselves from the world and do not drink or smoke. <br>
                                However, as it is difficult to quit on my own, those who are born again by the Holy Spirit must depend on God and follow His time schedule for change in my life.

                                There are people who attack with the question, “Do Christians not have parents?” However, more than any other religion, Christianity teaches to honor your parents (the 10 commandments).<br>
                                What is important is for you to know the secret of ancestral worship, which is having fellowship with the ghosts (1 Corinthians 10:20). If you spiritually look at it, it is the action of widely opening the doors to the ghosts. It is the work of satan to kill, take away, and drive to destruction (John 10:10). <br>
                                Ancestral worship is not a preserved tradition of our country, but what culture that the Chinese have made back in history. As they lived as bad children while their parents were alive, with the heart of regret, it is preparing food for their ancestors to eat. When ancestral worship is given, satan and the ghosts who have power over the air work. It is because idol worshiping will curse the 3-4 generations of the posterity (Exodus 20:4-5).

                                There may be people who think, “I do not go to church, but I have never given anyone harm and lived a good life. If there is such a thing as salvation, I would have it.” There are people who think that if they live a good, diligent  life, they will go to a good place afterlife. This is due to the vague religious consciousness that they may have. <br>
                                However, the matter of salvation does not depend on ethics or morals. It is because the reason for man’s destruction is due to sin and the way to solve that sin is salvation, but that cannot be done by man’s good deeds. <br>
                                The only way is by God’s son, Jesus Christ coming as man paying the price for our sin. 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus (Romans 3:23-24).  Man are like dirty garments in front of God and thus, cannot receive salvation by actons.

The creator God can do all things and the living God has His greatest interest in His children.

                                To first tell you of the conclusion, you can receive salvation by only believing in Jesus. <br>
                                "because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved." (Romans 10:9-10).<br>
                                The only way to receive salvation is by believing in Jesus. <br>
                                The problem of salvation and judgement is God’s absolute authority. Thus, man cannot understand it with their thoughts. The fact that you are able to hear of the exact Gospel is a great blessing of God and the evidence that you were chosen. Whether one believes in the Bible or not, the fact is that you will receive  judgment according to your actions (Revelation 20:12-14). In front of that place of judgment, no one can make an excuse. <br>
                                Excuses from man cannot miss the providence of God. God fulfills all things according to His Word. He is just and fair. Those who humbly come inside His love will have the greatest blessing.

                                Do you hight acknowledge yourself to the extent to the point to being compared to God? Man are weak and has limitations. There are many times that I cannot trust myself. Man can do many things, but there are more things that man cannot do. <br>
                                As if they die when they drink poison or as if a runner skews his position from the race is disqualified, if we skew our direction of life, we will live  a failed life. If one is on a pirate ship, even if one does what is good, his identity does not change. It is that he was a good pirate. <br>
                                The problem of sin, cannot be solved with morals, ethics, good deeds, good works or volunteering, but you must have the forgiveness  of sins (Romans 3:23, Romans 6:23) <br>
                                Those who acknowledge one’s powerlessness and limitations and come out in front of God are those who are wise.

                                The reason that God does not judge the evil people right away is because He wants all people to receive salvation  and know the truth (1 Timothy 2:4). <br>
                                God has sent His one and only son for the sinners to pay the price and had sent the Holy Spirit to tell of the news of salvation. Like so, God loves man until the end. It is because the one who is behind sin is not man, but the devil. Man are being deceived by satan. As satan will receive eternal punishment, he wants man to be destroyed like him as well. <br>
                                Realizing that you have been deceived by the devil and coming back to the Lord is repentance. This opportunity  does not eternally stand, but is only idle when you have your physical body. <br>
                                The worst and most scary curse is abandonment. There are those who do not even have the opportunity for repentance or salvation.

                                The word hersey means that it has a different end. However, it is that it has had a wrong start and has the following characteristics.<br>
                                1) it rejects the triune God (the Father, the Son, and Spirit)<br>
                                2) it rejects the fact that salvation is within only Jesus Christ<br>
                                3) more than the authority of the Bible, it suggests another power of authority and does not confess faith according the to Apostle’s Creed.<br>
                                4) the interpretation of the Bible is arbitrary, figurative, and the symbolic interpretations are used to make additional changes and errors.

                                The cross is a Christian symbol. Thus, one may think that a church must have this symbol and if it does not, one may question if it is a heresy. <br>
                                The cross was also used as a method of cruel execution by the Romans and the medieval  times. Jesus had to bear the cross up the hill and was crucified. Peter was hung upside down on the cross and Andrew was martyred in an X shape on the cross. Simon and Nathaniel also followed Jesus on the cross. <br>
                                Then, is it that all churches must have the cross as it symbolizes Christianity? It is not so. The cross is just a symbolic object. The cross itself is not salvation or the Gospel. Thus, if one wrongly interprets it in this way, it can become an idol. What is important is to know why Jesus had to bear the cross. Jesus had come as the Christ and became an atonement  and solved all our sins of the past, present and future problems. It is not the image that is important, but believing in Jesus Christ as your savior in faith. <br>
                                It is the free will of the senior pastor and the congregation to have the cross displayed in the church. Normally, the reason why churches display the cross in the church is to symbolize Christianity  and to remind and commemorate  the fact that Jesus had shed His blood on the cross for our sins and had won over death. That is why because a church does not have a cross, it is not a church. Do each denominations  have rules for displaying the cross? There are no such specific rules. The cross is used to symbolize Christianity, but there is no enforcement in using the cross.
